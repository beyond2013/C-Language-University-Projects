<<<SML Program for demonstrating average of 7 numbers using counter-controlled loop i.e. FOR loop, values can be +ve or -ve>>>

(In the following Program, all the variables are declared in the beginning and that's why I guess the program is not working
please refer to the program that's written below)

Location        WORD        Instruction
00              2002        Load the initial value of counter to accumulator
01              0001        Data word describing the value to decrement
02              0007        Data word describing the initial value for counter 
03              0000        Data word SUM
04              0000        Data word AVERAGE
05              0000        Data word currentValue
06              0000        Data word Current Counter     
07              2106        Store the value from accumulator to variable Current Counter
08              1005        Read value from terminal and save into variable currentValue
09              2005        Load value from currentValue to accumulator
10              3003        Add the value from variable sum to value in accumulator
11              2103        Store the value from accumulator to variable SUM
12              2006        Load the current counter to accumulator
13              3101        Subtract decrement value from value in accumulator
14              4217        If value in accumulator is equal to zero then move to location 17
15              2106        Store the current counter value         
16              4008        Repeat the process from location 08
17              2003        Load the value saved in variable SUM into accumulator
18              3202        Divide value in accumulator with the value in location 0602
19              2104        Store the value in variable average
20              1104        Write the value to the terminal from location 04
21              4300        HALT Program

(The following program works as all the variables and constant values are declared in the end)

Location	Word	Instruction
00	        2021	Load the initial value of counter to accumulator
01	        2117	Store the value from accumulator to variable Current Counter
02	        1016	Read value from terminal and save into variable currentValue
03	        2016	Load value from currentValue to accumulator
04	        3018	Add the value from variable sum to value in accumulator
05	        2118	Store the value from accumulator to variable SUM
06	        2017	Load the current counter to accumulator
07	        3120	Subtract decrement value from value in accumulator
08	        4211	If value in accumulator is equal to zero then move to location 11
09	        2117	Store the current counter value 
10	        4002	Repeat the process from location 02 i.e. again read another integer and so on
11	        2018	Load the value saved in variable SUM into accumulator
12	        3221	Divide value in accumulator with the value in location 21 i.e. value 7
13	        2119	Store the value in variable average
14	        1119	Write the value to the terminal from location 19 i.e. average value
15	        4300	HALT Program
16	        0000	Data word currentValue
17	        0000	Data word Current Counter
