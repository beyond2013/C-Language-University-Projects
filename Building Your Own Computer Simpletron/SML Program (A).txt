<<<SML program for demonstrating addition of values using sentinel-controlled loop until user enters negative value>>>
Location        WORD        Instruction
00              1001        Read Value and store in location 01  
01              0000        Variable VALUE
02              0000        Variable SUM
03              2001        Load Variable VALUE from memory into accumulator
04              4105        Check if the loaded value is negative if negative then move to location 05
05              1102        Write SUM from memory to terminal
06              4300        Halt(end program)
07              3002        Add Sum, take value from location 02 and add it to the value present in accumulator
08              2102        Store Sum, store the value from accumulator to location 02 i.e. SUM Variable
09              4000        Branch (00) move to location 00
